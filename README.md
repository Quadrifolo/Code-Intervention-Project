# 🔮 Quote Generator Workshop

Build a Quote Generator using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — perfect for beginners learning web development basics! Created for a live coding workshop to help new devs understand:

- 🧱 HTML: how to structure a webpage  
- 🎨 CSS: how to style it  
- ⚙️ JavaScript: how to make it interactive  
- 🔌 BONUS: API integration using OpenAI (demo only)

## 📁 Project Structure

quote-generator-workshop/
├── starter/ → Starter version (basic layout for live coding)
├── final/ → Fully working quote generator (local quote data)
└── openai-demo/ → Bonus version using OpenAI API (for demo purposes only)


## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone or download** this repository:


2. Open the `starter` folder in **VS Code**  
3. Use **Live Server** or open `index.html` directly in your browser

## ⚠️ About the OpenAI Demo

The `openai-demo` version shows how to call the OpenAI API from the frontend. This is only for demonstration purposes during the workshop — you should **never expose your API key** in a live or public project.

In a future session, we’ll show you how to:
- Use `.env` files properly
- Set up a secure backend to handle API requests
- Protect your keys and keep things safe 🔐
