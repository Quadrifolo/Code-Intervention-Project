# Session 3 – Prompt Engineering & AI Agents  
**The Code Intervention**

## Overview  
This session is designed to move you from *using AI tools* to *understanding how they think and work*.  
We’ll break down prompt engineering fundamentals and introduce AI agents as systems that can reason, act, and automate tasks — not just generate text.

This is a **practical, beginner-friendly session** focused on real-world thinking rather than hype or theory.

## What You’ll Learn  

### 1. Prompt Engineering Fundamentals  
- What a prompt actually is (and why wording matters)  
- How AI interprets instructions vs assumptions  
- The difference between vague prompts and structured prompts  

We’ll introduce a reusable **prompt framework**:
- **Role** – Who the AI should act as  
- **Task** – What you want it to do  
- **Constraints** – Rules, limits, or boundaries  
- **Output Format** – How the response should be structured  

---

### 2. Prompt Iteration & Control  
- Why first responses are rarely the best  
- How to refine prompts to get consistent outputs  
- How to reduce randomness and hallucinations  
- When to be strict vs flexible with instructions  

---

### 3. Introduction to AI Agents  
- What an AI agent actually is (vs ChatGPT)  
- How agents differ from simple prompts  
- The **reason → act → evaluate** loop  
- Real-world agent examples:
  - Content research agents  
  - Email / admin automation agents  
  - Simple decision-making assistants  

---

### 4. Low-Code Agent Thinking (Conceptual)  
We’ll discuss where tools like Make, Zapier, Flowise, and custom scripts fit:
- When low-code is enough  
- When custom code is required  
- Current limitations of AI agents (2026)  

This section is **thinking-focused**, not tool-heavy.

No prior AI or coding experience required.

---

## What You Don’t Need  
- No paid AI tools  
- No advanced programming knowledge  
- No hype or buzzwords  

---

## Outcomes  
By the end of this session, you will:
- Write clearer, more effective prompts  
- Guide AI behaviour intentionally  
- Understand what AI agents are — and what they aren’t  
- Apply these mental models across tools and projects  

---

## Next Steps  
After this session, you’ll be able to:
- Improve prompt quality immediately  
- Explore agent tools with confidence  
- Decide when to use low-code, custom code, or no automation
