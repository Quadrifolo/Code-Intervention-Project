# 🤖 AI Agent Build Section

A Practical Guide for Technical & Non‑Technical Builders

## 🎯 Goal

Learn how to think in agents, not just click buttons.

This guide uses three live builds from the workshop:

- 📨 **Email Draft Response Agent** (Beginner)
- 💡 **Business Idea Generator Agent** (Intermediate)
- 🧭 **Career Helper Agent** (Intermediate)

## 🧠 What an AI Agent Actually Is (Simple Definition)

An AI agent is a system that:

- Watches for inputs (triggers)
- Reasons about them using AI
- Produces useful outputs
- Can run without you being present

> Agents don’t just respond — they operate.

---

## 🧩 The Core Agent Pattern (Learn This Once)

Every agent you build in Make follows this pattern:

```
Trigger → Prepare Input → AI Reasoning → Process / Decide → Output
```

You will reuse this pattern for every agent you ever build.

## 🧪 DEMO 1: Email Draft Response Agent (Beginner)

**Pattern:** AI as Assistant — This agent is reactive. It helps you in the moment.

### ✅ What this agent does

- Watches your emails and waits incoming emails based on the timeframe
- AI drafts a clear, professional response
- Draft email is then sent to you to review 

### 🎯 When this is useful

- Writing emails
- Improving tone
- Speeding up admin work

### 🔁 Flow

```
Manual Trigger → AI Draft Response → Output
```

### 🛠️ Step-by-step

1. **Trigger — Watch Emails** (Outlook/Gmail)
   - Folder: Choose folder
   - Limit: How many emails to read

2. **Tools — Set Multiple Variables**
   - Email_Sender = Sender Email
   - Email_Subject = Subject
   - Email_Body = Body

3. **AI Reasoning — Make AI Agent**
   - **System instruction:** You are a professional assistant.
   - **User prompt:**

   ```text
   Draft a clear, polite, and professional reply to the email below.
   Keep the response concise and realistic.

   Email:
   {{Email_Sender}}
   {{Email_Subject}}
   {{Email_Body}}
   ```

4. **Output — Send Email (Outlook)**
   - To: Your email
   - Subject: Email Draft
   - Body: {{AI response}}

### 🧠 Teaching takeaway

> “This is AI responding to me — not acting on its own.”

This is an assistant, not a full agent yet.

## 🧪 DEMO 2: Business Idea Generator Agent (Intermediate)

**Pattern:** AI as Agent / System — This agent works for you, even when you’re offline.

### ✅ What this agent does

- Monitors RSS feeds
- Analyses content
- Generates business ideas
- Emails you a weekly report

### 🧠 Why this is a real agent

- External input (RSS)
- Clear goal (generate ideas)
- Reasoning, not summarising
- Runs automatically
- Produces usable insight

### 🔁 Flow

```
RSS Trigger → AI (JSON) → Parse JSON → Iterator → Text Aggregator → Email
```

### 🛠️ Step-by-step

1. **Trigger — Watch RSS Feed**
   - Example: `https://medium.com/feed/tag/entrepreneurship`

2. **Prepare Input (Optional)**
   - Use Text Aggregator to combine titles/summaries

3. **AI Reasoning — Make AI Agent**
   - **System Prompt:** You are a startup analyst.
   - **Prompt:**

   ```json
   From the content provided: {{text}}

   Generate 3 concrete business ideas.
   Each idea must include:
   - title
   - problem
   - audience

   Return ONLY valid JSON in this format:

   {
     "ideas": [
       { "title": "", "problem": "", "audience": "" }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. **Parse JSON**
   - Create structure: `ideas[] → title, problem, audience`
   - Strict mode: OFF

5. **Iterator**
   - Splits `ideas[]` into individual bundles

6. **Text Aggregator**
   - Formats report: Idea / Problem / Audience

7. **Email Output**
   - Sends weekly email with aggregated ideas
(Use this format for your body)

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; font-family: ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, 'Liberation Mono', 'Courier New', monospace;">
{{8.response}}
</pre>

## 🧪 DEMO 3: Career Helper Agent (Intermediate)

**Pattern:** Router + Specialists

### 🧱 Architecture

```
Input → Router Agent → Specialist Agent → Save to Notion
```

### Step-by-step

1. **Input Variables**
   - user_input (CV, job desc, etc)
   - goal (optional)

2. **Router Agent**
   - **Prompt:**

   ```text
   You are a classifier.
   Decide the type:
   - CV
   - COVER_LETTER
   - CAREER_PROGRESS

   Return ONLY one word.
   ```

3. **Make Router Node**
   - Routes(Apply Filters):
     - If Contains CV → CV Specialist
     - If Contains COVER_LETTER → Cover Letter Specialist
     - If Contains CAREER_PROGRESS → Career Specialist

4–6. **Specialist Agents**
   - Each:
     - Runs AI prompt
     - Produces output
     - Saves to Notion

## 🧠 Key Concepts Everyone Must Understand

### Assistant vs Agent

- **Assistant** = reacts when you ask
- **Agent** = operates on a schedule

### Iterator vs Aggregator

- **Iterator** = splits data
- **Aggregator** = combines results

### Why structure matters

- JSON gives control
- Structure prevents chaos

## 🧘 Final Mental Model

> “Assistants help me. Agents work for me.”

Once this clicks, you can build any agent in Make.
