Prompt Engineering & AI Agents Workshop Attendee Guide


From vague requests to automated intelligence

What Session is About

This workshop focused on using AI intentionally:


Writing clearer instructions



Reusing what works



Turning prompts into simple systems

The goal is less guessing, more consistency.



Key Concepts (Plain English)



Prompt
→ Instructions you give an AI.



Prompt Engineering
→ Structuring instructions so outputs are predictable and reusable.



AI Agent
→ A reusable prompt running inside a workflow that can take action.



Workflow
→ A set of steps that run automatically.

Why Vague Prompts Don’t Work



A prompt like:



“Write a motivational quote.”



Doesn’t fail — it’s just underspecified.



Without clarity, the AI has to guess:





Who it’s acting as



Who it’s speaking to



What “good” looks like



Different guesses = different outputs.

The Prompt Framework

Every strong prompt includes:


1) Role - Who The AI is acting as

2) Objective / Perspective – What outcome you want and the standards the AI should apply

3) Task – Exactly what the AI should do

4) Rules & Constraints – Boundaries, priorities, and limits


5) Output Format – How the response should be structured



Example Template

Role: 
You are a business specialist who is well skilled in growing businesses with limited time and finances across the world with a lot of business links.

Objective:
Produce a clear, actionable task breakdown that can be executed without follow-up questions.

Perspective:
Optimise for clarity, practicality, and realistic time constraints.

Task:
Break the brief into a step-by-step plan.

Audience:
A non-technical founder.

Context:
The founder is running the project solo with limited time and no budget.

Rules & Constraints:
- Use plain English
- Avoid jargon
- Max 200 words
- Include risks and mitigations

Output Format:
Markdown with sections:
1) Summary
2) Step-by-step plan
3) Risks & mitigations
4) Next 3 actions

Validation Check:
Ensure the plan is realistic for one person to execute within two weeks.








Key Insight



Every line in a prompt should remove ambiguity.


If it doesn’t reduce guessing, it probably doesn’t belong there.

Why One-Off Prompts Don’t Scale


One-off prompts lead to:





Inconsistent outputs



No feedback loop



Easy loss of what worked
















































































You can tweak them — but nothing compounds.


The Solution



Reusable prompt templates

Templates turn prompts into assets you can:





Reuse



Improve



Share



Automate

From Prompts to AI Agents



At a high level, an AI agent works like this:

Trigger → AI → Action
























































Example:





A schedule starts the workflow



The AI applies a reusable prompt



The result is sent somewhere automatically

This is how prompts become systems.

Tool We Are Using Today


Make -  https://www.make.com/en


Make allows you to:





Build workflows visually



Connect AI to real tools (email, docs, APIs)



Automate tasks without heavy coding


The tool matters less than the thinking.

Key Considerations


When using AI in workflows:





Be clear about what the AI should and shouldn’t do



Define inputs and outputs clearly



Keep tasks small and focused



Add human review where it matters

Small constraints make automation usable.



Final Takeaway


Prompts → Agents → Products

Once you understand this flow, the tools become secondary.
