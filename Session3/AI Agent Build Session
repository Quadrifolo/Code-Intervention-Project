AI Agent Build Section

A Practical Guide for Technical & Non‑Technical Builders

# Goal
Understand how to think in agents, not just click buttons.
This guide uses two live builds from the workshop:
• Email Draft Response Agent (Beginner)
• Business Idea Generator Agent (Intermediate)

# What an AI Agent Actually Is (Simple Definition)
An AI agent is a system that:
- Watches for inputs (triggers)
- Reasons about them using AI
- Produces useful outputs
- Can run without you being present

Agents don’t just respond — they operate.
# The Core Agent Pattern (Learn This Once)
Every agent you build in Make follows this pattern:
Trigger → Prepare Input → AI Reasoning → Process / Decide → Output

You will reuse this pattern for every agent you ever build.

# DEMO 1: Email Draft Response Agent (Beginner)
Pattern: AI as Assistant

This agent is reactive. It helps you in the moment.
What this agent does
• You paste an email
• AI drafts a clear, professional response

No automation complexity. No background logic.
When this pattern is useful
• Writing emails
• Improving tone
• Speeding up admin work

Flow overview:
Manual Trigger → AI Draft Response → Output

## Step-by-step
1. Trigger - Watch Emails (Microsoft Outlook/Gmail)
Set folders, limits, etc.

2. Tools - Set Multiple Variables (Sender, Subject, Body)

3. AI Reasoning - Use Make AI Agent with clear prompt

4. Output - Send to Outlook with formatted email body
Teaching takeaway: “This is AI responding to me — not acting on its own.”
This is an assistant, not a full agent yet.

# DEMO 2: Business Idea Generator Agent (Intermediate)
Pattern: AI as Agent / System

This agent works for you, even when you’re offline.

What this agent does
• Monitors RSS feeds
• Analyses content
• Generates business ideas
• Emails you a weekly report

Why this qualifies as an agent
• External input (RSS)
• Clear goal (generate ideas)
• Reasoning, not summarising
• Runs automatically
• Produces consumable insight

Flow overview:
RSS Trigger → AI Reasoning (JSON) → Parse JSON → Iterator → Text Aggregator → Email Report

## Step-by-step
1. Trigger - RSS Feed
2. Prepare input (Text Aggregator)
3. AI Reasoning - Generate JSON
4. Parse JSON (Define structure)
5. Iterator (Split ideas)
6. Text Aggregator (Combine report)
7. Email Output

# DEMO 3: Career Helper AI Agent (Intermediate)
1. Trigger/Input - Set variable or Manual Trigger
2. Router Agent (Manager Brain) - Classifies input
3. Router - Creates branches: CV / Cover Letter / Career Progression
4. Branch logic - Each branch runs an agent and saves to Notion

# Key Concepts Everyone Should Understand
Assistant vs Agent
- Assistant = reacts when you ask
- Agent = operates on a schedule

Iterator vs Aggregator
- Iterator = splits data
- Text Aggregator = combines outputs for reports

Why structure matters
- JSON gives control
- Structure prevents chaos
Final mental model (remember this):
“Assistants help me.
Agents work for me.”

Once you understand this, you can build any agent in Make.
