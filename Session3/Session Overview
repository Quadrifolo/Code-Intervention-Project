# 🤖 Prompt Engineering & AI Agents Workshop Attendee Guide

### *From vague requests to automated intelligence*

---

## 🔍 What This Session Is About

This workshop focuses on using AI **intentionally**:

- Writing clearer instructions  
- Reusing what works  
- Turning prompts into simple systems  

🎯 **Goal**: Less guessing, more consistency.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts (Plain English)

- **Prompt** → Instructions you give an AI  
- **Prompt Engineering** → Structuring instructions so outputs are predictable and reusable  
- **AI Agent** → A reusable prompt running inside a workflow that can take action  
- **Workflow** → A set of steps that run automatically

## ⚠️ Why Vague Prompts Don’t Work

A prompt like:

> “Write a motivational quote.”

...doesn’t fail — it’s just **underspecified**.  
Without clarity, the AI has to guess:

- Who it’s acting as  
- Who it’s speaking to  
- What “good” looks like  

🌀 Different guesses = different outputs.

## 🧩 The Prompt Framework

Every strong prompt includes:

1. **Role** – Who the AI is acting as  
2. **Objective / Perspective** – Desired outcome and lens  
3. **Task** – What the AI should do  
4. **Rules & Constraints** – Boundaries to follow  
5. **Output Format** – Structure of the response
